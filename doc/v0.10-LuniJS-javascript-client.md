##LuniJS - A Javascript client library for FirmataWithDeviceFeature 

The purpose of this LuniJS client library is to provide access to the LuniLib device drivers that are installed on an Arduino.  This client library is written in Javascript, and communicates with the Arduino via the Firmata protocol (as implemented in the existing javascript firmata library, and as extended by a proposed new FirmataFeature module `DeviceFeature` and a pair of new Sysex commands `DEVICE_QUERY` and `DEVICE_RESPONSE`).

The Arduino side of this architecture is described in a number of documents included with the Luni library.  Please refer to those documents for more detailed descriptions of each device driver and the functions that they can perform.

Since the Device Feature may not ever be incorporated into the main line of ConfigurableFirmata on the Arduino, I created a forked version named FirmataWithDeviceFeature that does include the new feature.  If the feature is mainlined, then the fork will go away.

This document describes one of the possible FirmataWithDeviceFeature client libraries: LuniJS.


##Introduction

Luni device drivers for the Arduino are designed to allow a client-side application to control remote devices attached to a Firmata server.  This is similar to the function of the existing Firmata command set, but at a somewhat higher level of abstraction.

The LuniJS client library continues the idea of moving up the levels of abstraction.  Although the user of the library can make direct calls to a device driver proxy, the library also provides modules named \<target\>API.js.  These modules contain methods that are called with arguments that are meaningful at the application level (degrees, power level, strings, etc) and which emit events with application-relevant data when completed.  

The API methods generally make one or more calls to device drivers on the Arduino in order to compose their results, but the caller works at the application level and does not need to be concerned with the details of the device driver arguments or of the specific Firmata messages that are transmitted.

###Terminology

Some terms with specific meanings for this feature are *device*, *logical unit* and *handle*.

- Device.  A device driver can control one or more instances of a specific *device* type.  The capabilities of the driver are determined by the device type, and are equally available to all the instances of the device. Each driver is given a simple name to identify the device type.  For example, DDMCP9808 is the name of a device driver for the MCP9808 temperature sensor.  DDHello is the name of a virtual device driver that deals with "Hello World" type messaging.
- Logical Unit.  Each instance of a device is a *logical unit*.  A device driver can handle one or more logical units, depending on device capabilities and device driver implementation. Each logical unit is given a name based on the device name.  For example, if there are two MCP9808 boards connected to a single server, then they could be referred to as MCP9808:0 and MCP9808:1.
- Handle.  When a logical unit is first opened, a *handle* that uniquely identifies the device and logical unit of interest is returned to the caller for use in future operations.  The handle is valid until the logical unit is closed.

###LuniJS Architecture

The modules of LuniJS provide application-specific APIs to the caller.  The details of those APIs vary depending on the device target (real, virtual, or a combination).  Some of the existing module APIs are specified later in this document.  

Underlying these API modules, there is a proxy device driver module that accepts the standard device driver calls `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`.  This proxy reformats the arguments for transmission via Firmata, and passes them on to the firmata.js library.  

firmata.js communicates with FirmataWithDeviceFeature on the Arduino, which passes requests on to the specific device driver.  When the device driver returns a result, it goes back to FirmataWithDeviceFeature, and then over the wire to firmata.js which passes them back to the proxy.  The proxy processes the received message and passes a response object to the calling API module.  That module processes the response object to obtain application level data, and then emits an event to tell the calling application that the call is complete.

###Interoperability

The DeviceFirmata feature uses the Firmata messaging protocol to send data between a client computer and an Arduino host.  The DeviceFirmata feature implementation is fully compliant with the requirements of ConfigurableFirmata and is simple to include (as has been done in FirmataWithDeviceFeature).

However, Firmata is more than just a message format.  The protocol specification document describes the goal of the package this way:

> The intention of this protocol [firmata] is to allow as much of the microcontroller to be controlled as possible from the host computer.

One impact of this intention is that, in order to control every last detail remotely, you need to have knowledge of every last detail in the first place.  This explains the presence of various administrative commands in the Firmata protocol such as `CAPABILITY_QUERY`, `ANALOG_MAPPING_QUERY`, and `PIN_STATE_QUERY`.  Some Firmata client libraries make use of these commands to create a "known state" description, and then maintain that as each client command is processed.

In contrast to the goal of detailed control mentioned above, the primary emphasis in the design of the Luni library is on pushing implementation of detailed functionality down to the Arduino.  The device driver specification allows implementation of real, virtual, and hybrid target devices, and encourages locating as much capability as possible on the Arduino side of the wire.

This can cause problems with existing Firmata client libraries, depending on how insistent they are about knowing and controlling the state of every pin and hardware device.  There are at least two areas where these goals can conflict.

One issue is due to memory constraints.  In order to save memory (both code and data) for use by the device drivers, one technique is to leave out all the other features in ConfigurableFirmata.  This works unless the client library expects certain commands to be present, no matter the configuration.  This is a problem, for example, if a client depends on AnalogFirmata being present but it has not been installed.

A second issue is that even if the administrative function responses were re-implemented for use in a componentized Firmata implementation, there is not always a good way to respond with descriptors that are accurate and compatible with Firmata's belief that what it knows is all there is to know. Device driver usage of pins does not necessarily map cleanly to Firmata pin modes.  If one attempts to use Firmata pin modes to describe how the drivers are using the pins, Firmata gets the idea that it owns the pins and can use them itself as usual, which can cause havoc.

Using LuniJS as an example client we can see the effects of the above issues.  LuniJS uses the existing firmata.js library to communicate.  firmata.js provides a very simple and easy to use hook for adding custom Sysex commands and that is how `DEVICE_QUERY` and `DEVICE_RESPONSE` are implemented.  However, during firmata Board initialization, it expects to use the administrative commands listed above, and if AnalogFirmata is not installed, the program grinds to a halt.  Fortunately, firmata.js also provides a way to skip that step via an option to the constructor and so all is well.

Similarly, going up the stack, Johnny-Five makes various assumptions about who is allocating access to pins and capabilities, and it can be difficult to implement anything fancier than "ignore this pin" as the mode for all driver-related pins.  Even that can be problematic for Johnny-Five because it does not want to use such pins for anything.

For the time being, I believe that an accurate statement regarding interoperability is

> LuniJS implements a Firmata client library that uses the standard Firmata protocol to communicate with an Arduino.  The library modules can be called from a Javascript application running under node.js.  
> 
> On the Arduino, DeviceFeature implements a FirmataFeature that uses the standard Firmata protocol (with the addition of the `DEVICE_QUERY` and `DEVICE_RESPONSE` messages) to communicate with a client host.
